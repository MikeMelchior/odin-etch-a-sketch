# odin-etch-a-sketch

For this project I will be practicing more DOM manipulation to make an 'etch-a-sketch'.

I am mostly done with creating everything that is asked for in the project guidelines, I am getting more comfortable using event listeners, targeting, creating and removing elements and their id's/classes. and i have set this project up completely with a skeleton html using purely javascript. This has been a challenge but one that I have gained a ton of knowledge working on.
